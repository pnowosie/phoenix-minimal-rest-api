# Phoenix minimal rest api project
Minimal rest api project with Elixir's Phoenix 1.3. 

## Depends (only) on
 * phoenix (~> 1.3.2)
 * cowboy (~> 1.0)

All unneccessary dependecies, files, code are shaved off.

## How to run 
```
mix deps.get
mix phx.server
```

Please let me know whether there is easier way to get Phonix project for api.
